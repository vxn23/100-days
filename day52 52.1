Q102: Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
arr = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5
Output 1:
2

Input 2:
arr = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20
Output 2:
-1

Input 3:
arr = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0
Output 3:
0

Input 4:
arr = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 2
Output 4:
2

  //Solution:

  #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[100], n, x, i, index = -1;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    scanf("%d", &x);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] >= x) {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", index);
    return 0;
}
